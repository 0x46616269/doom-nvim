# Doom Modules

Here lies all the built-in modules for Doom Nvim. But what are these modules?

All the submodules here are Doom plugins, that is, they are plugins made in
Doom and for Doom that you will find only in Doom.

## List of plugins

- runner (WIP)
  - A built-in function for pressing a few keybinds and executing a REPL for
    the current filetype inspired by SpaceVim one. e.g. if you are editing a
    Python file then `SPC - c - r` will open a window with Python REPL
    _obviously_.
- compiler (WIP)
  - A built-in function like the repl one but for compiling
    _and running (optionally)_ your programs. By example, for compiling and
    running your Rust program you will only need to press `SPC - c - r`
    and Doom will take care of your rusty code. Otherwise if you only want
    to compile then you can press `SPC - c - c`.

> **NOTE:** you can find more information about each plugin in the respective
> plugin directory.
